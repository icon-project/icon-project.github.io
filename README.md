# ICON - Hyperconnect the World

ICON is a scalable smart contract enabled blockchain platform with an innovative consensus mechanism, decentralized
governance structure, and a long-term goal of interoperability between enterprise and public blockchains.

As a brief overview of the technical details: ICON has smart contracts known as SCOREs that are written in Python,
an enhanced BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) based algorithm known as LFT, and a concept known as “Virtual Step”
allowing SCORE operators to cover user transaction fees.

Our goal is to Hyperconnect the World, and by combining groundbreaking technology, a strong community, and relentless
growth strategies we believe this goal is reachable.
