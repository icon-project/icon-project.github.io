# Quickstart Guide

Intended audience are the developers who are new to ICON, but are familair with programming languages and have basic SW development experience. The purpose of this guide is to help you setup the SCORE developement environment, and deploy your first SCORE quickly without touching any in-depth knowledge.

This tutorial is in three parts. In part 1, you will get familar with the developement tools, and the local testing environment. You will write a simple SCORE, and excute it on your PC. In part 2, you will learn how to deploy the SCORE onto the testnet, and write a python client code to interact with it. Part 3 willl explain how to set up your own private devnet on AWS.

#### Part 2. [HelloWorld on testnet](quickstart_p2.md)

- Configure ICONex to connect to the testnet
- Create an account in ICONex
- Get test ICX
- Transaction fees
