# Part 2. Hello World on testnet

In this part 2, we will deploy the HelloWorld SCORE onto the testnet. You will learn how to configure your tools to interact with the testnet.

## Configure ICONex to connect to the testnet

If you have not installed ICON Chrome wallet, here is the chrome web store [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iconex/flpiciilemghbmfalicajoolhkkenfel).

ICON Chrome wallet is connected to the mainnet. You can switch to other network by changing its configuration. 

- Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing F12, then go to the **Application** tab. In the **Storage** section, expand **Local Storage**.
- Add a new key/value pair, **isDev/true**, by clicking on the empty row at the bottom of the table.
- Reload your wallet, then you will see the menu in the bottom. Click the **ICX (SERVER)** button to open the dropup list of the available networks. Select **YEOUIDO** network, this is a testnet for DApp developers. 

Please refer to the [network guide](icon_network.md) for more information.



## Create an account in ICONex

Let's create an account in ICONex, and download the keystore file. Full guideline of creating a keyfile is [here](wallet.md#create-an-account).

We will use this keystore file on testnet. The keystore file downloaded from ICONex will look something like `UTC--2018-10-06T06_00_02.195Z--hxbac99ffea54749ca1c86ab4e6bfe0b630bf7a7a0`. As you may have noticed, the latter part of the filename is your address, `hxbac99ffea54749ca1c86ab4e6bfe0b630bf7a7a0` in this example. Let's rename the file to `keyfile_test2` for human readibility. 



## Get test ICX

You need ICX to deploy and invoke a SCORE on testnet, because every transaction on testnet requires a fee. To receive testnet ICX, please send email to `testicx@icon.foundation` with following information.

- Testnet node url
- Address to receive the testnet ICX, the one you created and downloaded above.

Check your balance from CLI, or in the ICONex. 

```console
# tbears -u https://bicon.net.solidwallet.io/api/v3 balance [account]
```



## Transaction fees

[Transaction fees explained](step.md).  

- `stepLimit` in transaction request message

  Every transaction request message has a `stepLimit` field. This value can not exceed the "maximum step limit" defined in the Governance SCORE. 

  ```
  {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "icx_sendTransaction",
      "id": 1234,
      "params": {
          "version": "0x3",
          "from": "hxe7af5fcfd8dfc67530a01a0e403882687528dfcb",
          "to": "cx9a4c4229ab2cbd61a5cc051fbbb6ee7e3e3adfac",
          "stepLimit": "0x123450",
           ...
  ```

- `stepUsed` in transaction result 

  You may have already noticed that every transaction result returns a `stepUsed` field. This is the actual amount of step consumed by the transaction. It is a good practice to test against T-Bears to figure out the step amount required by each transaction. On T-Bears, step is calculated but the step price is set to zero, so transaction fee is always zero. T-Bears will return `Out of step` error, if the step usage reaches the `stepLimit` value in your trasaction request. 

  ```
  {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "result": {
          "txHash": "0xc40cbbf2b89cd1e2890....",
          "blockHeight": "0x3158",
          "blockHash": "0x9e0c1385128bf0d4257....",
           ...
          "stepUsed": "0x4d361d0",
           ...
  ```

- `Out of step` error in transaction result

  When you recieve an `Out of step` error, increase the `stepLimit` in the request message. The value should be larger than `stepUsed`.

  ```
  {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0", 
      "result": {
          "txHash": "0x9f512fe4b431d8780d75c29ad307f3....", 
          ...
          "stepUsed": "0x4d361d0",
          "status": "0x0", 
          "failure": {
              "code": "0x7d64", 
              "message": "Out of step: contractSet"
          }
          ...
  ```



## Configure T-Bears CLI to see the testnet

We will modify the default cli configuration file, "tbears_cli_config.json", for testnet. In this config file, we will set `uri`, `nid`, and `stepLimit`. 
Every CLI commands lookup the `uri` from the config file if `-u` option is not given. `deploy` command uses `nid` and `stepLimit` values in this file. 

```
{
    "uri": "https://bicon.net.solidwallet.io/api/v3",
    "nid": "0x3",
    "keyStore": null,
    "from": "hxe7af5fcfd8dfc67530a01a0e403882687528dfcb",
    "to": "cx0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "stepLimit": "0x5000000",
    ...
}
```



## Deploy HelloWorld to the testnet (T-Bears CLI)

Unlike T-Bears emulated environment, on testnet, valid signature is required to send a transaction. So, every transaction request will require a keystore file to sign it. 

`tbears deploy` command with `-k [keystore_file]` option will install the SCORE on testnet. Target network info (uri, nid) is read from the default config file. Don't forget to get the SCORE address from the transaction result. 

```console
root@07dfee84208e:/tbears# tbears deploy hello_world -k keystore_test2
root@07dfee84208e:/tbears# tbears txresult [txhash]
```



## Execute HelloWorld (T-Bears CLI, Python)

#### T-Bears CLI

Same command will invoke `hello` method on testnet. Read-only function call does not require keystore file. Testnet `uri` is read from the default config file. Just make sure you correctly updated `to` and `from` values in the "call.json" request message.

```console
root@07dfee84208e:/tbears# tbears call call.json

root@07dfee84208e:/tbears# cat call.json 
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "icx_call",
    "id": 1,
    "params": {
        "from": "hxbac99ffea54749ca1c86ab4e6bfe0b630bf7a7a0",  <-- test2 address
        "to": "cx9a4c4229ab2cbd61a5cc051fbbb6ee7e3e3adfac",  <-- SCORE address on testnet 
        "dataType": "call", 
        "data": {
            "method": "hello" 
        }
    }
}
```


#### Python SDK

We will create a "hello.py" to invoke a `hello` method of the contract on testnet. Use the actual SCORE address and keystore password in your code.

```python
from iconsdk.icon_service import IconService
from iconsdk.providers.http_provider import HTTPProvider
from iconsdk.wallet.wallet import KeyWallet
from iconsdk.builder.call_builder import CallBuilder

node_uri = "https://bicon.net.solidwallet.io/api/v3"
network_id = 3
hello_world_address = "__SCORE_ADDRESS__"
keystore_path = "./keystore_test2"
keystore_pw = "__PASSWORD__"

wallet = KeyWallet.load(keystore_path, keystore_pw)
tester_addr = wallet.get_address()
icon_service = IconService(HTTPProvider(node_uri))

call = CallBuilder().from_(tester_addr)\
                    .to(hello_world_address)\
                    .method("hello")\
                    .build()

result = icon_service.call(call)
print(result)
```

Because you don't need to sign your read-only function call request, creating a wallet instance from the keystore file is not a mandatory step. Wallet instance is created just to get your account address. 

Run the code. 

```console
$ python3 test.py
Hello, hxbac99ffea54749ca1c86ab4e6bfe0b630bf7a7a0. My name is HelloWorld
```
